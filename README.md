# plot.ly-challenge
What bacteria can you find in a belly button? More importantly, with health information, can you model it in a way that's visually appealing and accessible to personal who most wants to view this data?
Welcome to the belly button dashboard. This project creates a webpage that plots various information regarding belly button bacteria using visuals. A drop down menu allows you to change the patient number and update the visuals. 
This project finds its data from a JSON file, connected via JavaScript to an HTML that displays the code. 
You can open the webpage by clicking the link below.
If you drill into the folder static and further into js, you'll find my app.js.
