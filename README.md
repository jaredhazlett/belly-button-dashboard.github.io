# plot.ly-challenge
Welcome to the plot.ly challenge.
In this repository to start you'll an html and samples.json. The html is what the code acts upon
while the samples.json contains all of the belly button data.
If you drill into the folder static and further into js, you'll find my app.js, or the javascript
file that holds my code. 
This assignment was particularly challenging. 
Thanks.
